# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Using regression models to predict the medical charges using various factors.

We used a Loan price dataset for this project.

In this project we used 2 models:

1.)Linear Regression

2.)RandomForestRegressor

We compare the performance of both models using evaluation methods metrics like RMSE and r2_score.
| Model                | RMSE ($) | RÂ² Score |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| Linear Regression    | 5,875    | 0.77     |
| Random Forest        | 5,066    | 0.83     |

In conclusion Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression using complex interactions.

This project demonstrates how simple regression models can effectively predict insurance charges using only a few key features.  

The smoker status proved to be the most impactful factor on medical cost predictions.
